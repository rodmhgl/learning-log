# Very Basic Terraform Project for Google Cloud Platform

This is a very basic Terraform project for Google Cloud Platform (GCP). It creates a single virtual machine (VM) instance in GCP and is only intended to demonstrate the basic boilerplate for a GCP project.

This project was created using the Hashicorp tutorial available at: [https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started).
